# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist Louise who is a playwright, and is trying to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She is estimating a budget of $10,000 but is hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. Our task is to help her make a decision by analysing crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that makes a project's campaign susccessful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to analyze the different crowdfunding campaigns, I filtered the data by their launch dates and whether the results of the crowdfunding campaigns were successful, failed or canceled. 

I further filtered the type of these crowdfunding campaings by those that were "Theater" based. This was to better match my findings with the needs of my client who is planning to crowdfund a theater Play.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To further analyze the data, I created several array of goals which were set for the theater plays in our data to determine the the susccess rate of these plays in different amount ranges. 

This would help me to better determine whether the crowdfunding campaign goal louise is estimating for her new play would be viable or not based on previous results for similar plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

In order to give Louise a more solid result, it would have been preferred if the data that was provided to me had better information of the play catagory provided, such as the genra  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
