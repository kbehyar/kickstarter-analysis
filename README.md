## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist Louise who is a playwright and is trying to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She is estimating a budget of $10,000 but is hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. My task is to help her decide by analyzing the dataset provided to determine whether there are specific factors that makes a project's campaign successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To analyze the different crowdfunding campaigns, I filtered the dataset by launch dates and whether the results of the crowdfunding campaigns were successful, failed or if they were canceled. 
I further filtered the type of these crowdfunding campaigns by those that were "Theater" based. This was to better match my findings with the needs of my client who is planning to crowdfund a theater Play.
The result and a graph of my findings can be found at the links below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To further analyze the dataset, I created several arrays of goals which were set for the theater plays in our dataset to determine the success rate of these plays for different goal amounts. 
This would help me to better determine whether the crowdfunding campaign goal Louise is estimating for her new play would be viable or not based on previous results for similar plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

To give Louise a more solid result, it would have been preferred if the dataset that was provided to me had better information of the plays categories. For example, the genre of the play Louise is planning compared the genre of the other plays in this dataset. It would be helpful to determine what type of plays people are interested in and are willing to pledge to. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Between the months of May â€“ August there was a larger number of crowdfunding campaigns organized which had a higher rate of being successful.  
2) In general, Theater crowdfunding campaigns have a very low rate of being canceled. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1) Majority of the crowdfunding campaigns for plays have a goal of less than $15,000.  
2) Campaigns with goals of less than $5,000 have a very high success rate and campaigns with goals of over $15,000 have a high Failure rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset could benefit more if it included the genre of different crowdfunding campaigns

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1) Pledge amounts and backers for different parent category can be compared to analyze which types of campaigns have higher number of backers (More popular). A scatter plot to better show most campaigns people are more interested in.
2) Launch dates and deadlines can be compared to better see how much time a certain campaign dedicated time to and whether they were successful or not.
3) Which countries prefer which types of campaigns based on parent and subcategories.
