## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help Louise who is a playwright, and wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. She is estimating a budget of $10,000 but is hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. Our task is to help her make a decision by analysing crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that makes a project's campaign susccessful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to analyze the different crowdfunding campaigns, I filtered the data by their launch dates and whether the results of the crowdfunding campaigns were successful, failed or canceled. 

I further filtered the type of these crowdfunding campaings by those that were "Theater" based. This was to better match my findings with the needs of my client who is planning to crowdfund a theater Play.
